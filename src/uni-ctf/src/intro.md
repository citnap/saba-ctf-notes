# University CTF

This is the write-up for the CTF competition held at my exchange university.
The challenges in this CTF primarily focus on network protocols and understanding how they work, as the overall theme of the event is **Networking**.

This CTF consists of 5 challenges. Unfortunately, I got only 3 of them -_-
